## Unstable Branch

The `main` branch is not stable. Please see the
[releases](https://github.com/maennchen/ZipStream-PHP/releases) for a stable
version.

## Overview

A fast and simple streaming zip file downloader for PHP. Using this library will
save you from having to write the Zip to disk. You can directly send it to the
user, which is much faster. It can work with S3 buckets or any PSR7 Stream.

Please see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for licensing and warranty information.

## Installation

Simply add a dependency on maennchen/zipstream-php to your project's
`composer.json` file if you use Composer to manage the dependencies of your
project. Use following command to add the package to your project's dependencies:

```bash
composer require maennchen/zipstream-php
```

## Usage

For detailed instructions, please check the
[Documentation](https://maennchen.github.io/ZipStream-PHP/).

```php
// Autoload the dependencies
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// create a new zipstream object
$zip = new ZipStream\ZipStream(
    outputName: 'example.zip',

    // enable output of HTTP headers
    sendHttpHeaders: true,
);

// create a file named 'hello.txt'
$zip->addFile(
    fileName: 'hello.txt',
    data: 'This is the contents of hello.txt',
);

// add a file named 'some_image.jpg' from a local file 'path/to/image.jpg'
$zip->addFileFromPath(
    fileName: 'some_image.jpg',
    path: 'path/to/image.jpg',
);

// finish the zip stream
$zip->finish();
```

## Upgrade to version 3.0.0

### General

- Minimum PHP Version: `8.1`
- Only 64bit Architecture is supported.
- The class `ZipStream\Option\Method` has been replaced with the enum `ZipStream\CompressionMethod`.
- Most clases have been flagged as `@internal` and should not be used from the outside.
  If you're using internal resources to extend this library, please open an issue so that a clean
  interface can be added & published.
  The externally available classes & enums are:
  - `ZipStream\CompressionMethod`
  - `ZipStream\Exception*`
  - `ZipStream\ZipStream`

### Archive Options

- The class `ZipStream\Option\Archive` has been replaced in favor of named arguments in the
  `ZipStream\ZipStream` constuctor.
- The archive options `largeFileSize` & `largeFileMethod` has been removed. If you want different
  `compressionMethods` based on the file size, you'll have to implement this yourself.
- The archive option `httpHeaderCallback` changed the type from `callable` to `Closure`.
- The archive option `zeroHeader` has been replaced with the option `defaultEnableZeroHeader`
  and can be overridden for every file.
- The archive option `statFiles` was removed since the library no longer checks filesizes this way.
- The archive option `deflateLevel` has been replaced with the option `defaultDeflateLevel`
  and can be overridden for every file.
- The first argument (`name`) of the `ZipStream\ZipStream` constuctor has been replaced with
  the named argument `outputName`.

### File Options

- The class `ZipStream\Option\File` has been replaced in favor of named arguments in the
  `ZipStream\ZipStream->addFile*` functions.
- The file option `method` has been renamed to `compressionMethod`.
- The file option `time` has been renamed to `lastModificationDateTime`.
- The file option `size` has been renamed to `maxSize`.
