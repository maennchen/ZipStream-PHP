## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT License

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the

## Workflow for Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your branch from `main` if you plan to implement new functionality or
   change existing code significantly; create your branch from the oldest branch
   that is affected by the bug if you plan to fix a bug.
3. Implement your change and add tests for it.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Ensure the code complies with our coding guidelines (see below).
6. Send that pull request!

Please make sure you have
[set up your user name and email address](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)
for use with Git. Strings such as `silly nick name <root@localhost>` look really
stupid in the commit history of a project.

We encourage you to
[sign your Git commits with your GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/signing-commits).

Pull requests for new features must be based on the `main` branch.

We are trying to keep backwards compatibility breaks in ZipStream-PHP to a
minimum. Please take this into account when proposing changes.

Due to time constraints, we are not always able to respond as quickly as we
would like. Please do not take delays personal and feel free to remind us if you
feel that we forgot to respond.

## Coding Guidelines

This project comes with a configuration file (located at `/psalm.yml` in the
repository) that you can use to perform static analysis (with a focus on type
checking):

```bash
$ .composer run test:lint
```

This project comes with a configuration file (located at
`/.php-cs-fixer.dist.php` in the repository) that you can use to (re)format your
source code for compliance with this project's coding guidelines:

```bash
$ composer run format
```

Please understand that we will not accept a pull request when its changes
violate this project's coding guidelines.

## Using ZipStream-PHP from a Git checkout

The following commands can be used to perform the initial checkout of
ZipStream-PHP:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:maennchen/ZipStream-PHP.git

$ cd ZipStream-PHP

```

## Running ZipStream-PHP's test suite

After following the steps shown above, ZipStream-PHP's test suite is run like

There's some slow tests in the test suite that test the handling of big files in
the archives. To skip them use the following command instead:

```bash
$ composer run test:unit:fast
```
